\title{Fit Simple CJS-like Survival per Reach (placeholder)}
\usage{
fit_survival(histories, model = "cjs", formula = ~1)
}
\arguments{
\item{histories}{A list returned by \code{build_detection_histories()}, containing at least
\code{$wide}. Must have \code{route_sites} attribute.}

\item{model}{Character; currently only \code{"cjs"} is supported (placeholder).}

\item{formula}{Formula; ignored in this placeholder, present for API compatibility.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{survival}: data.frame of reach-level estimates with Wald CIs.
\item \code{route_sites}: route site order used.
}
}
\description{
Computes simple apparent survival estimates between consecutive sites along a route.
This is a placeholder "CJS-style" approach: for reach i (site i → site i+1),
the survival estimate is calculated as
\eqn{\hat{\phi}_i = (#tags detected at site i+1) / (#tags detected at site i)}.
Wald confidence intervals are approximated using a binomial assumption on the logit scale.
