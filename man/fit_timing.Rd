\usage{
fit_timing(
  observations,
  time_col = "event_time",
  by = "day",
  quantiles = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9),
  method = c("quantile", "gam")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observations}{data.frame of observations containing a time column.}

\item{time_col}{name of the timestamp column (POSIXct or parseable).}

\item{by}{aggregation unit, currently "day".}

\item{quantiles}{numeric vector of quantiles to compute (0..1).}

\item{method}{currently "quantile" (placeholder). "gam" accepted but returns same structure.}
}
\value{
A list with \code{daily} (data.frame of counts/cumulative) and \code{quantiles} (data.frame).
}
\description{
Computes daily counts and requested quantiles of passage based on event timestamps.
