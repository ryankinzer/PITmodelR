\title{Fit Migration Timing Metrics (Placeholder)}
\usage{
fit_timing(
  observations,
  time_col = "event_time",
  by = "day",
  quantiles = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9),
  method = c("quantile", "gam")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observations}{Data frame or tibble of observation events containing a timestamp column.}

\item{time_col}{Character; name of the column containing event timestamps (POSIXct or parseable). Default: "event_time".}

\item{by}{Character; aggregation unit for counts. Currently only "day" is supported. Default: "day".}

\item{quantiles}{Numeric vector of quantiles to compute, in the range \link{0, 1}. Default: c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9).}

\item{method}{Character; method to compute timing metrics. Options: "quantile" (default) or "gam" (placeholder, returns same structure).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{\code{daily}}{Data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{date}}{Date of the aggregation unit.}
\item{\code{n}}{Number of events on that date.}
\item{\code{cum_n}}{Cumulative number of events through that date.}
\item{\code{prop}}{Cumulative proportion of total events through that date.}
}
}
\item{\code{quantiles}}{Data frame of requested quantiles with columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{q}}{Requested quantile.}
\item{\code{date}}{Date corresponding to the quantile.}
}
}
\item{\code{method}}{Character indicating which method was used ("quantile" or "gam").}
}
}
\description{
Computes daily counts and requested quantiles of passage based on event timestamps.
Currently supports simple daily aggregation; more advanced methods (e.g., GAM smoothing)
are accepted as arguments but return the same structure in this placeholder.
