summarize_arrival_travel(
  tag_history,
  locs_def,
  site_col = "site_code",
  tag_col = "tag_code",
  time_col = "event_time",

}
\arguments{
\item{tag_history}{data.frame/tibble with at least \code{tag_code}, \code{site_code}, \code{event_time}.}

\item{locs_def}{Either a character vector of ordered occasions (e.g., c("SECTRP","ZEN",...)),
or a named list mapping occasion -> one or more site codes
(e.g., list(LGR=c("GRJ","GRS","LGR"), Down=c("LMN","MCN","BON"))).}

\item{site_col}{Column name containing site codes (default "site_code").}

\item{tag_col}{Column name containing tag IDs   (default "tag_code").}

\item{time_col}{Column name with event timestamps (default "event_time").}

\item{tz}{Time zone used when parsing \code{time_col} if it is character (default "UTC").}

\item{keep_unknown}{logical; keep events whose site_code is not in \code{locs_def}? (default FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\itemize{
\item arrivals_long:  first-arrival time per tag x occasion (long)
\item arrivals_wide:  first-arrival time per tag (wide by occasion)
\item travel_long:    travel time (days) per tag and leg (o_i -> o_{i+1})
\item occasion_summary: arrival-time quantiles by occasion
\item leg_summary:       travel-time quantiles by leg
\item mapping: site_code -> occasion, occ_idx
\item dropped_summary: counts of unknown sites (if removed)
}
}
\description{
Given raw tag events and a survival-location definition, returns:
\itemize{
\item First-arrival time at each occasion per tag
\item Travel time between consecutive occasions per tag
\item Per-occasion arrival summaries (n, quantiles)
\item Per-leg travel-time summaries (n, quantiles)
}
}
